## Single Server Queue System

 

The application simulates the single server processes the job one after the other. In this case, the arrived jobs line up in a queue and are served on a FCFS (first come first served) discipline.

A service time factor is provided to define the proficiency of the server. The required process time for a job is therefore the service time of the job multiplied by the factor.
